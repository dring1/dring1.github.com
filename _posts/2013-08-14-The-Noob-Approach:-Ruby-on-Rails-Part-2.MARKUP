Aside from installing rails one of the most difficult things I faced was deciding where the hell I should start?
				I googled and googled until I compiled a list of resources range from absolute beginner to intermediate levels.
				So I started from the bottom of the list - beginner. 
				I will admit I made a huge <strong>mistake</strong> when starting off. I had very little knowledge of ruby prior to 
				starting rails development.
				A huge mistake. I strongly advise trying such sites as:
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://rubymonk.com/">rubymonk.com</a></li>
					<li>Codeschool's entry level ruby course<a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-ruby"> try-ruby </a></li>
				</ul>
