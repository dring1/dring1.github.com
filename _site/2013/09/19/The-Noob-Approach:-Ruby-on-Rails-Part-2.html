<div class="blog-contents">
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you come to a point in your rails learning when you say to yourself, “Shit, I’ve done multiple tutorials and a 
		bunch of reading but I still don’t have a clue". Well I am going to share the steps I took to go from zero to (amateur-mediocre) 
		hero.</p> </br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countless times I have tried going on youtube and some other sources and to
		watch some rails tutorials thinking I would absorb it
		quickly. At this point in my development career I was really only familiar with the standard OO languages taught in universities (
		Java,C,C++[maybe you got lucky with your school and
		they diversified a little more]). So ruby was a new beast and I could not handle it. I gave tryruby.org a try and thought I could 
		jump into rails development. After that I finished 
		railstutorial.org and still felt that I really didn’t have a firm grasp on rails. At this point I thought I had better start from the 
		ground up. I picked up The Well Grounded 
		Rubyist and that is when it all began to click.</br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is my recommendation and opinion on the steps required to understanding the fundamentals of rails, if you 
		have any suggestions 
		please post in the comments.</br></br>


		<ol>

			<li> <p> <strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1933988657"> Get to know Ruby </a></strong> </br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Well-Grounded Ruby - a great book, although it is a little dated, it deals with ruby 1.9.X. 
				There is absolutely nothing about rails in the book. It will introduce you into the fundamentals of ruby and some of the more 
				unique aspects of the programming language.
				This can be an optional book as, the subset of ruby requred for amateure rails development is  quite minimal, although I do 
				recommend trying something of a pure ruby nature.
				Alternatively, you can take  a gander at codeschool’s <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits">Ruby Bits</a> 
				screencasts
			</p> </li> 

			<li> <p> <strong> <a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">CodeSchool.com - Rails for Zombies ($25/month subscription) </a></strong>
			</br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greg Pollack and the code school team do a phenomenal job presenting a very diverse number of ruby and rails 
			screencasts. The Rails for Zombies screencasts will be a reality check whether or not rails is for you. These beginner level 
			screencasts are a great way to implement practical uses of rails with a very helping hand. Try your hand as well on the more
			advanced rails tutorials aswell.
		</p> </li> 


		<li> <p> <strong> <a href="http://railscasts.com/"> Railscast ($9/month subscription) </a></strong> </br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some this may be a bit early to introduce you to a set of screencasts that mostly deal with more advanced 
			topics in rails development. But! I am a visual learner and watching the Ryan Bates (a professional rails dev) do his job was potentially the best training 
			technique I can advise. He does a 
			great job of forcing the viewers to understand what is going on implcitly and explicity in rails.
			At firstI really did not understand everything that was going on at first, but as time goes on it all begins to make sense.
		</p> </li> 


		<li> <p> <strong><a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/"> Rails Tutorial (Free)</a></strong> </br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael Hartl’s step-by-step guide to rails. A free PDF or 15 hours of paid screencasts are available. The 
			tutorial will take you from a brand new rails app to a full-blow twitter like application. Although I suggest maybe making 
			yourself familiar with the basic concepts of rails on 
			codeschool before jumping into this book, as railstutorial.org is quite a lot of information to take in.
		</p> </li> 

		<li> <p> <strong> DIY  </strong> </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, try building something on your own. This is much easier said than done.
			I started working on a website called Lousylandlord.ca (still under construction …) and I learned mostly from my mistakes, as 
			learning should be. Stackoverflow quickly became my friend.	</p> </li> 

		</ol>
		<p>
			That’s a wrap, I hope this can point you in the right direction!

			Best of luck with taming the beast that is rails.
