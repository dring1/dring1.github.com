			<br> Currently employed at the Bank of Canada in Ottawa as a contract employee working on a massive Windows 7 Deployment project.<br>
			I am enrolled at Carleton University for my 4th year into my undergrad in Computer Science: Internet &amp; Network security.

			I have taken a great interest in web development in the last few months and will be looking to kick off a small start up in 2013.<br>
			I am in the beginnings of my software contributions to the open-source world.
