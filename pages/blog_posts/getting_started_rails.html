<p> One of the most daunting tasks for getting started with Rails may be the fact that installing it can be quite a bitch.
So, for your linux users I have supplied a quick bash script to simplify the task. </p>

<span>What installs? </span>
<ul>
	<li>RVM</li>
	<li>Ruby 1.9.3</li>
	<li> Rails 3 </li>
	<li>nodejs</li>
	<li>A smack load of libraries</li>
	<li>cURL</li>
</ul>

Additionally the script will attempt to load the rvm environment on login.

If you wish to use more modern versions of software you must edit the script yourself.

You <underline> must </underline> run the script from a login shell inorder to install correctly.

The script will <strong> only </strong> function on Linux with bash. 

The script is available here : <a> download </a>
 <a href="https...." > git repo </a>

If you have any questions feel free to comment or contact through github.
