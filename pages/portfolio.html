		<li class = "Title"> <a href="https://github.com/dring1/XAMPP-LINUX-64-bit-fix"> XAMPP 64-Bit Ubuntu based fix </a></li>
			<p class="desc"> During the school year we were told to use the XAMPP server for our projects, funny enough I have been using 64-but Linux Mint for my Projects. It just seemed impossible for XAMPP install properly there were some definite fixes online I just decided to share my working copy with the world. The error is uniquely bound to 64-bit linux.</p>
		<li class="Title"> <a href="https://github.com/dring1/dring1.github.com"> This website </a> </li>
			<p class = "desc"> This website was built purely with HTML/JS/CSS. I used the Jekyll Ruby Gem to allow for quick deployment &amp; frequent udpating. Will definitely be using Jekyll again for any static websites.</p>
